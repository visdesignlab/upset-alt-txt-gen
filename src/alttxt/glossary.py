  "Elements": "elements are discrete entities, such as people, movies, countries. They are often the rows in tables, and we record attributes about them.",
  "Set": "a set is an attribute of an element that expresses a “part-of”, “is-a”, “has-a” relationship, and so on. For example, a person can be in a club (a part-of relationship), or a car can be of a type, such as a convertible (an is-a relationship). They are often columns in a table.",
  "Set sizes": "set sizes count how many elements are in a certain set. For example, if a dataset has 100 cars as elements, and 30 of the cars are convertibles, the set size of the set “convertibles” is 30.",
  "Intersections": "sets of attributes commonly intersect. For example, a car can be both, in an “electric” set and in the “convertible” set.",
  "Intersection size": "the number of elements that are in a particular intersection.",
  "All-set intersection": "a special intersection that is of all sets in the dataset.",
  "No-set intersection": "a special intersection that contains the elements that are in no set in the dataset.",
  "Individual-set intersection": "a special intersection that contains elements that are only in one set but not in any others.",
  "Low-degree intersections": "intersections between only a few sets.",
  "High-degree intersections": "intersections between many sets."
