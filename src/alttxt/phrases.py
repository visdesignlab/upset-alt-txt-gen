"""
The context-free grammar which the alt text is generated from-
not to be confused with the JSON export of the data, which is
also referred to as a grammar.

Syntax:
The "level_x" keys denote the semantic level of the contained descriptions.
Within the level keys, the "low", "medium", and "high" keys denote the verbosity, 
AKA verbosity, of the contained grammar. These level/verbosity combinations
are used as start symbols, with the specific combination being chosen by command-line args.
Each starting phrase contains a variety of symbols. Terminal symbols are enclosed in {{}}.
Non-terminal symbols are enclosed in [[]]. Terminal symbols are evaluated by the TokenMap
class, which has to perform some computation to get the value of the token. Non-terminal
are evaluated by the grammar itself, and mappings for non-terminals are defined in the 
"symbols" key within the grammar, which is itself a dict. Note that non-terminals can 
technically be terminal, as long as their mapping doesn't contain any values that need
to be computed by the TokenMap. Note that when feeding symbols to both the TokenMap 
and the grammar, the symbols must be stripped of their enclosing brackets.
