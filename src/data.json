  "longDescription": "# UpSet Introduction\nThis is an UpSet plot that visualizes set intersection. To learn about UpSet plots, visit https://upset.app.\n\n# Dataset Properties\nThe dataset contains 17 sets and 6303 elements, of which 6 sets are shown in the plot.\n\n# Set Properties\nThe set sizes are diverging a lot, ranging from 127 to 1200. The largest set is Comedy with 1200 elements, followed by Action with 503, Adventure with 283, Children with 251, Crime with 211, and Documentary with 127.\n\n# Intersection Properties\nThe plot is sorted by size in descending order. There are 24 non-empty intersections, all of which are shown in the plot. The largest 5 intersections are Just the empty inter (1777), Just Comedy (1003), Just Action (283), Just Crime (131), and Just Documentary (123).\n\n# Statistical Information\nThe average intersection size is 161, and the median is 31. The 90th percentile is 283, and the 10th percentile is 3. The largest set, Comedy, is present in 45.8% of all non-empty intersections. The smallest set, Documentary, is present in 8.3% of all non-empty intersections.\n\n# Trend Analysis\n The intersection sizes peak at a value of 1777 and then drastically flatten down to 1. The empty intersection is present with a size of 1777. An all set intersection is not present. The individual set intersections are large in size. The low degree set intersections lie in medium sized intersections. The medium degree set intersections can be seen among small sized intersections. No high order intersections are present.\n\n"
